### How does the Oyster daily cap work?
For example, if you load £10 onto your Oyster card and travel by underground in central London (zone 1):

If you make 1 journey £2.40 is deducted from your card
If you make 2 journeys, £4.80 is deducted
If you make 3 journeys, £6.60 is deducted
Your 4th and all other journeys until 4.30am the following morning are free and £3.40 will remain on your Oyster card

### Best option for visitors
For visitors, the best option is to add the cost of the daily cap to your card x the number of full days in London. Add a little extra to cover any single journeys at the start or end of your trip if necessary. For example, to and from Heathrow airport.

If you do this then you don’t need to worry about topping up your card again. If there is money on your Oyster card at the end of your trip, you can get it back along with the £5 deposit.

Aim to have £10 or less of Pay as you go money on your card at the end of your trip and you can easily get a refund at an underground station ticket machine. Refunds are more complicated if you have more than £10 left on your card.


### Rail services Peak/Off-Peak

### London Eye Tips

Booked at 17.15 - 17.30

* We have two entrances to board the Coca-Cola London Eye. Depending on what ticket types you have, will depend on which entrance you join. All standard tickets include standard entry onto the Coca-Cola London Eye. The standard queue is located to the right hand side of the London Eye. Please note, you must have your tickets to hand before joining the queue.
* We advise you arrive around 30 minutes before your chosen experience (longer during peak periods) or 45 minutes before if having a Champagne experience or a special package (Cupid's Capsule or Private Capsule) allowing enough time to collect your tickets and enjoy our 4D Experience.
* One rotation on the London Eye will take around 30 minutes.
